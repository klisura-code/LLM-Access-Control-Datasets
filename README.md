# LLM Access Control Datasets

This repository provides two large-scale datasets and companion scripts for studying **permission-aware reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The datasets extend popular text-to-SQL benchmarks, Spider and BIRD, with role-based access control (RBAC) metadata, enabling systematic evaluation of models that must decide whether a user’s SQL query should be *permitted* or *denied* under defined access policies.

## 📘 Dataset Overview

| Dataset | # Databases | # (User, Query) Pairs | # Permitted | # Denied | Size | 
|----------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Spider** | 153 | 19.6K | 8K | 11K | ~9 MB | 
| **BIRD** | 80 | 35.8K | 11.9K | 23.9K | ~220 MB | 

Each record includes:
- `question` — natural-language query  
- `sql` / `sql_wrapped` — executable SQL  
- `policy_sql` — role-based GRANT statements  
- `schema_ddl` — database schema (introspected from PostgreSQL)  
- `user` — simulated role (`User_1`–`User_4`)  
- `decision` — `PERMIT` or `DENY` (ground truth)  
- `sqlstate` and `error` — PostgreSQL response code and message

## 🧩 Roles and Policies

Each database includes **four user roles** representing realistic organizational access tiers:

| Role | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `User_1` | Full read access (admin/senior analyst) |
| `User_2` | Limited tables (department-level) |
| `User_3` | Full tables but restricted columns (masked sensitive data) |
| `User_4` | Minimal visibility (external/junior role) |

Permissions are defined through automatically generated SQL `GRANT` statements reflecting **table- and column-level constraints**.  
Ground truth decisions are computed by executing each query under the user’s role in PostgreSQL and logging the resulting outcome.

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org-or-user>/LLM-Access-Control-Datasets.git
cd LLM-Access-Control-Datasets
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python ≥3.9 is recommended.
